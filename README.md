# Antenna Pattern Simulations

## Description
In this repository, you can python simulations for antenna array and other antenna simulations. All the simulations are based on Molisch and Goldsmith Wireless Communications books. If you are interested to use these simulations, you can find and read all the theories regarding antenna array and basic antenna know how on those books. 

Feel free to use all the simulation codes for your study and research. Just don't forget to cite this github repo, okay?

Anyway, thank you for stopping by. I hope all of these can give you some help. 

## How to Run the Code
To run the codes, use this steps:
- Install `ipython3` on your computer. 
- Install the required python modules such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pylab`, and `Pillow`.
- On command prompt (windows) or on terminal (linux), type `ipython3` and enter. 
- On `ipyhton3` console, write `%run python-file-name.py` and enter to run the code.
- Enjoy.
