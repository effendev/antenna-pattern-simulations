# Antenna Pattern in Polar Plane

## Description
In this repository, you can find a python codes for simulating antenna pattern in polar plane. Some interesting things you can play with is the `radar-phased-array-pattern.py` which simulated the phase array radar while scanning nearby objects. 

To run the codes, use this steps:
- Install `ipython3` on your computer. 
- Install the required python modules such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pylab`, and `Pillow`.
- On command prompt (windows) or on terminal (linux), type `ipython3` and enter. 
- On `ipyhton3` console, write `%run python-file-name.py` and enter to run the code.
- Enjoy.
