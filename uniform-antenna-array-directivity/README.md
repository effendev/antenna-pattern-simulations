# Antenna Array Simulations

## Description
In this repository, you can python simulations for antenna array with three different geometric configurations. The three configurations are Uniform Linear Array (ULA), Uniform Plannar Array (UPA), and Uniform Circular Array (UCA).

Feel free to use all the simulation codes for your study and research. Just don't forget to cite this github repo, okay?

Anyway, thank you for stopping by. I hope all of these can give you some help. 

## How to Run the Code
To run the codes, use this steps:
- Install `ipython3` on your computer. 
- Install the required python modules such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pylab`, and `Pillow`.
- On command prompt (windows) or on terminal (linux), type `ipython3` and enter. 
- On `ipyhton3` console, write `%run python-file-name.py` and enter to run the code.
- Enjoy.
