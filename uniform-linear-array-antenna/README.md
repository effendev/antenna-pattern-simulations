# Uniform Linear Array Antenna Simulations

## Description
In this repository, you can find python codes for simulating array factor pattern of Uniform Linear Array (ULA) antenna. The simulated ULA is made for the 60 GHz frequency band planned for the future 5G communication. I created this simulation in order to really understand how distance separation between elements affecting the array factor pattern of the antenna. 

Feel free to use and cite this github repository if you use this code for your study or publications.
